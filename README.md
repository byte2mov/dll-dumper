# DLL Dumper

## Overview

This tool is a simple DLL dumper designed to work across many different pay-to-cheat (P2C) platforms. **Note:** This code is provided "as-is" and comes with no warranties of any kind.

## How It Works

### A Brief Introduction to Injector Behavior

Injectors for P2C platforms work in various ways, depending on the level of anti-cheat protection in place.

- **Simple Injectors** (for games without anticheats) often use:
  - `CreateRemoteThread`
  - `CreateProcess` with the `PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD` flag

- **Advanced Injectors** (for games with anticheat mechanisms) typically:
  - Utilize kernel drivers
  - Allocate writable and executable memory regions in the target process

---

### Focus of This Project

Most modern injectors don’t drop their modules/payloads onto the disk. Instead, they either:

- Download the module from a server
- Store it in bytes, load it into memory, and inject it without writing a traditional DLL file to disk

Here's an example of an injector function that would load a module into memory:

```cpp
void inject_function(BYTE* dll) {
    // Access NT headers or handle the DLL
    allocate_memory(dll);
}
```

The goal is to hook this injection process, capture the memory region where the payload is injected, and dump it.

## Steps to Use

### Finding the Inject Function

1. **Locating the Function**:
   - Look for where `VirtualAlloc` is called in the injector code.
   - Alternatively, check for output messages like "Injecting," which could lead you to the injection function.

2. **Example**: 
   Let’s assume the injection function offset is `0x00401234`. You found it using a disassembler like IDA.

3. **Hooking the Function**:
   - Use **MinHook** to hook the inject function.
   - Access the NT headers, check the size of the payload, and dump the bytes accordingly.

---

### Code Example

Here's a basic structure of how the hooking process works:

```cpp
// Define the type of the inject function
typedef void (*inject_function_t)(BYTE*);

// Variable to hold the original pointer to the inject function
inject_function_t original_inject = nullptr;

// Hook function (e.g., hk_inject)
void hk_inject(BYTE* dll) {
    // Perform the dump or any other operation before or after the original function is called
    original_inject(dll);  // Call the original function
}

// Initialize MinHook and set the hook
MH_Initialize();
MH_CreateHook((LPVOID)0x00401234, &hk_inject, reinterpret_cast<LPVOID*>(&original_inject));
MH_EnableHook(MH_ALL_HOOKS);
```

---

## Final Notes

- The method described here works for many types of injectors, but it may depend on the specific P2C or game setup.
- Finding the right injection point may require some manual reverse engineering with tools like IDA or a debugger.
